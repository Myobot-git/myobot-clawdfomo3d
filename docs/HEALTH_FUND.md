# Health Research Fund 🏥

## What is it?

MyobotFomo3D dedicates 5% of every round's pot to a health research fund. This is what makes us different from the original ClawdFomo3D.

## Why?

Myobot is an AI companion focused on health & healing. Our games should reflect our values.

Instead of 100% degen, we're doing **95% degen + 5% good**.

## How it works

| Event | Distribution |
|-------|--------------|
| Round ends | 5% of pot → Health Fund |

The fund accumulates over multiple rounds. When meaningful amounts are reached, funds are withdrawn to support:

- Patient advocacy organizations
- Neuromyofascial science research
- Open-source health tools
- Community health initiatives

## Transparency

- Health fund balance is visible on-chain: `healthFundBalance()`
- All withdrawals emit `HealthFundWithdrawn` events
- Recipients will be announced publicly

## Governance (Future)

As the Myobot community grows, we may implement:

- Community voting on fund recipients
- Quarterly donation reports
- Partnership with established health organizations

## Fund Recipient

Current recipient is a multisig controlled by the Myobot team. Long-term goal is community governance.
